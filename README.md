##Getting Cleaning Data Course Project
The script "run_analysis.R" does the tasks listed in course project assignment. These tasks are:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

the "run_analysis.R" script contains all the code needed to preform these tasks.


##  Steps taken to produce the tidy data set.

Details are in the CodeBook.md and comments in the "run_analysis.R"  Script.  All steps needed to process the data and produce the tidy dataset are done by the "run_analysis.R" script.  If the data set is not already present in the working directory, internet access is required to download the data.
